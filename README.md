- Hi, I’m Matthew. I’m currently studying MSci Physics and am conducting a Master's project on frontiers in THz sensing (2024-25). I am constructing my own material parameter extraction algorithm in Python for THz-TDS measurements, and characterising the absorption of THz radiation in sample materials. This will form the foundation of the main task ahead, which is to characterise high-resistivity float-zone silicon (HRFZ-Si) wafers that have been bombarded by neutrons. This will be achieved using the new neutron beam facility at the University of Birmingham. After extracting the material parameters of the HRFZ-Si, I will explore the possibility of utilising the material for high Q-value whispering-gallery mode resonators or photonic crystals.
- I’m interested in Physics and Engineering R&D in a range of areas including nuclear and particle physics, quantum sensing and detector physics and putting theory into practise.
- Past projects have included: Reverse engineering of chips using [EDX and scanning electron microscopy](https://matthew-dbrown.github.io/SEM/poster.pdf), Electron spin resonance in [dpph](https://matthew-dbrown.github.io/ESR/ESR_report.pdf), Gamma ray spectroscopy, PID Control for magnetic levitation, and the characterisation of CMOS sensors and [scintillation detectors](https://matthew-dbrown.github.io/NUC/scintillation_characterisation.pdf).

- Hi, I’m Matthew. I’m currently studying MSci Physics and am starting a Master's project on frontiers in THz sensing 2024-2025. I will be exploring the electromagnetic properties of commercial optical fibres at THz frequencies and design appropriate couplers for transmission measurements. 
- I’m interested in Physics and Engineering R&D in a range of areas including nuclear and particle physics, quantum sensing and detector physics and putting theory into practise.

- Hi, I’m Matthew. I’m currently studying MSci Physics and am starting a Master's project on silicon photonics 2024-2025. I will be examining the effects of high radiation doses on the perfomrance of high speed processors that are to be used in future upgrades to the LHCb experiment at CERN for higher data readout at 100 Gbps. 
- I’m interested in Physics and Engineering R&D in a range of areas including nuclear and particle physics, quantum sensing and detector physics. I enjoy putting theory into practise and have completed a variety of laboratory projects.
- Past projects have included: Gamma ray spectroscopy, PID Control for magnetic levitation, Electron spin resonance, Reverse engineering of chips using EDX and scanning electron microscopy and the characterisation of CMOS sensors and scintillation detectors.
- I have studied core physics moodules: Mathematics and Statistics, Classical Mechanics, Quantum Mechanics, Thermal Physics, Solid State Physics, Particle Physics, Nuclear Physics, 
- I have studied additional modules in: Scientific Computing, Electronics, Fission and Fusion, Medical Physics, Atomic Physics.
- I will be studying further modules in: Image Processing and Communication, Physics of Renewable Energy, Solid State Physics, Nanophotonics, Superconductivity, Statistical Methods, Particle Physics.

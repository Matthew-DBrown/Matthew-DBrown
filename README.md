- Hi, I’m Matthew. I’m currently studying MSci Physics and am starting a Master's project on frontiers in THz sensing 2024-2025. I will be exploring the electromagnetic properties of commercial optical fibres at THz frequencies and design appropriate couplers for transmission measurements. 
- I’m interested in Physics and Engineering R&D in a range of areas including nuclear and particle physics, quantum sensing and detector physics and putting theory into practise.
- Past projects have included: Reverse engineering of chips using [EDX and scanning electron microscopy](https://matthew-dbrown.github.io/SEM/poster.pdf), Electron spin resonance, Gamma ray spectroscopy, PID Control for magnetic levitation, and the characterisation of CMOS sensors and scintillation detectors.
